# Real Estate Sales Data Analysis
## Introduction:
This repository contains a jupyter notebook comprising the code, visualization, and analysis of real estate data in King County, Washington State. This project, part of IBM's Data Science Certificate, aims to predict the real estate sale prices of dwellings based on a number of features from data collected during 2014 to 2015. In this project, machine learning techniques are used to build predictive models following exploratory data analysis. The models are then assessed via cross-validaton and the results are interpreted and discussed. 

## Libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Outline
- Import and preprocess the dataset.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to evaluate correlations between features and sale prices.
- Develop linear regression models to predict house prices with various features.
- Employ pipelines to integrate preprocessing and model building.
- Improve model using Ridge regression method and polynomial transformation.
- Validate model robustness through cross-validation.
- Discuss results and implications
